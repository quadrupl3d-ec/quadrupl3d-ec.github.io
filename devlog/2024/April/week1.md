# **April Week 1**
## **Monday: April 1**
- 9:20  AM: Signed In.
- 10:00 AM: Trying to fix: `Scale and move woodworks not working in Modular after undo.` No luck.
- 12:00 PM: Still not able to figure out why woodwork furns are moving in wrong direction in production. X and Z axis 
- 12:45 PM: If the woodwork is rotated, the furnishing that will be added to the woodwork will also have that rotation incorporated by default and that is causing the problem I guess. So, 90 degree clockwise is interchanging the X and Z axes and so on.
