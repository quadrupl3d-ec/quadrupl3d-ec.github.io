## **Monday: April 8**
- 9:30  AM: Signed In.
- 11:00 AM: Trying to get the `.blend` file from the beta render worker but seems like it is getting removed even if the `clean_up` is removed from `render_worker_startup.sh`
- 12:00 PM: Using the local frontend and cloud backend. `debug = True` will result in presisting the render folder in the VM. Got the `.blend` file. Started testing for day light renders.
- 1:00  PM: Able to move the mouse freely. Pressing `Shift + ~` together to activate fly mode. Using `W S A D` to move the camera as if in a game. Can use the mouse scroll to increase/decrease the camera move speed.

- 5:00  PM: **Fixed: **Not able to scale or move a component in modularUI after undo.
