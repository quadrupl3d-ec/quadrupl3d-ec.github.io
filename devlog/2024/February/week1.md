- 9:20  AM: Signed in.
- 10:30 AM: When I click on save, the constructor of Cupboard.js is initialized again, and setting `this._doorType = double`,
Meaning the problem is definitely not inside `Cupboard.js`. `onSave()` calls `saveWoodwork()` and after this point I'm a bit confused like how the function call stack will be executed. ðŸ¤” (**#75**)
- 11:00 AM: Fixed: `Show material interface on clicking on 3D`. (**#131**)
- 12:30 PM: Done with the debugging call with sir, fixed the issue ! **;)** (**#75**)
- 1:30  PM: Submitted the PR's for 2 bug fixes. (**#131 and #75**) and opened a new issue (**#192**)
