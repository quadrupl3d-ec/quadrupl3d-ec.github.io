# **February Week 3**
## **Monday: Februrary 19**
- 9:20  AM: Signed in.
- 11:00 AM: Visualizing the casted ray to check the authenticity of `_computeTranslation(x, y);`
- 12:00 PM: If `a1a2` vector is perpendicular to any axis, then we get incorrect results about the `min. distance from ray calculation.` Why is that happening ?
- 1:30  PM: Done with the call with Ab sir. Got some valuable insights about the implementation of `ShiftPointer.`
- 3:00  PM: How to select the point of intersection so that A1A2 vector will lie in the plane containing the axis ?
- 4:00  PM: Submitted **PR #230** (**#225**)
- 5:15  PM: Submitted **PR #273**. Snap the furnishing to walls. (**#222**)
- 6:30  PM: How to differentiate the meshes that correspond to the interior face of a wall which are intersected by the raycaster ?
- 7:00  PM: Maybe the face vertices can help the raycaster in identifying the meshes that correspond to interior walls ?
