- 11:00 AM: Visualizing the casted ray to check the authenticity of `_computeTranslation(x, y);`
- 12:00 PM: If `a1a2` vector is perpendicular to any axis, then we get incorrect results about the `min. distance from ray calculation.` Why is that happening ?
- 1:30  PM: Done with the call with Ab sir. Got some valuable insights about the implementation of `ShiftPointer.`
