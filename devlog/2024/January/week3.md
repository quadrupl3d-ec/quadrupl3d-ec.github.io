- Final polishes in the `shift-pointer` plugin.
- Reducing the code length by using the `Array.prototype.filter` method on array, using ternary operator to convert an if-else block in a one liner.
- Rebasing and merging the pr in the master branch.
- Syncing the fork and pulling the latest master.
- Can't request renders through the UI. It says `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'unshift')`. Why is that happening ?
Is this same code works in other system ?
- There is an authentication error while requesting assets from Azure Blob storage. These two endpoints are not working because of this issue.<br>
`/projects/<pid>/renders` <br>
`/projects/<pid>/layouts/<lid>`<br>
This is happening because of the expired `CLIENT_KEY`.
- On syncing the fork, pulling the latest master, why this issue persists ?

## **Monday: January 15**
