# **January Week 3**

## **Friday: January 15**
- Code refactoring. Keeping in mind the fundamental software development practices and the notion of `python zen`.
- Learning about good code, organising my code better.
- Refactoring the `_computeTranslation()` in order to reduce the exposure of a bug.
