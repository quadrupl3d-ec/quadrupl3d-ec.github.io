Setting up ecdocs and SSH access on my github account.

## **Friday: December 22**

Kali Linux is not much compatible for development environment. I've tried to access the docs at `http://localhost:9999` but there were missing development dependencies therefore switched to Ubuntu upon Ab's directives.  
Deployed the web application on docker.
